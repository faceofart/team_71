2. Our Topic is Unmanned Drone Based Aerial Pesticide Sprayer. This technology is based on drone which aims have an impact on agricultural development by helping the farmers working on the fields.
3. Usually a farmer carries the spray with them and visits the field physically to spray the pesticides on the land. But we aim to make this process unmanned. We plan to set booths at several locations where the farmer visits the booth, pays for the pesticide and provides the address of the land. The operator will control the drone with mobile app technology. He will fill the tank of the drone with the required fertilizers, set the location of the land using GPRS as well as the retuning route and sends the drone to that field. The drone uses this information to reach the land, sprays the pesticides and returns back. So there is zero involvement of human with the harmful pesticides.
4. This technology helps general people in three main ways:
Time, Value and Health. 
Starting with the first point time, usually it takes 8 hours to spray 15kgs of fertilizers on the land. But with the help of our system it only takes 30 minutes to spray the same fertilizer. This saves a huge amount of time.
Coming to the second point, it cost around 15-20 USD in this normal process but it will cost only 2-3 USD with the drone technology
The third point is the health issues. In a research we found that this pesticides exposure causes several diseases such as neurological and skin disease. According to a research by WHO, around 3million worker are affected from which 18000 dies.
All these issues can be solved with the use of this drone technology. 
6. We have calculated and found that this technology reduces 10% of the effect that I have mentioned earlier which saves 1800 in one year. We believe this percentage will gradually increase every year making the technology 100% effective.
